<Steps>

<Step>Setup Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui.</Step>

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4. Ensure your project is also configured for Tailwind v4 (see the [Tailwind v4 Upgrade Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) and [shadcn/ui Tailwind v4 docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4)) **before** proceeding with shadcn/ui setup.

Then, follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to initialize shadcn/ui in your v4 project.

<Step>Install Base UI Components.</Step>

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @base-ui-components/react
```

<Step>Add `Root` class to your app layout.</Step>

```tsx {2} title="layout.tsx"
<body>
	<div className="isolate">{children}</div>
</body>
```

<Step>Add Based UI theme to your project.</Step>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latestadd "https://ui.fldr.zip/r/theme.json"
```

<Step>That's it! You can now install the components.</Step>

# Icons

9ui uses [`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev/) for icons.

For a more extensive collection of icons, consider using [`Monicon`](https://monicon-docs.vercel.app/), which offers over 200,000 icons from various popular libraries.

If you are looking for animated icons, the [`pqoqubbw/icons`](https://icons.pqoqubbw.dev/) library is a great choice.

### pnpm

pnpm add -D tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next

Configure Tailwind according to the [v4 upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) (using `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@theme` in your CSS).

### pnpm

pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init

Follow the prompts.

## 3. Install Base UI Components

## 4. Add Root class to your app layout

Update your layout file (e.g., `layout.tsx` or `layout.jsx`):


// layout.tsx or layout.jsx
<body>
  <div className="isolate">{children}</div>
</body>

## 5. Add Project Theme Variables

### pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn add "https://ui.fldr.zip/r/theme.json"

## 6. That's it! You can now install the components.

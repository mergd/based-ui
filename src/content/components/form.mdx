## About

9ui utilizes [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) to build efficient, flexible, and scalable forms. React Hook Form is a lightweight library that optimizes performance by minimizing re-renders and simplifying form state management.

Why React Hook Form?

- Performance: Uses uncontrolled components, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- Easy Integration: Works seamlessly with controlled and uncontrolled inputs.
- Validation: Supports built-in validation and integrates with libraries like [`Zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
- Minimal Boilerplate: Reduces the amount of code needed to handle form state and validation.
